# Daily Order Excel Sorter

Created using React + Vite

This app will allow users to upload an excel sheet with the daily orders and from there go to the shipping status column and return a new sheet that has just the orders that haven't been shipped yet. 

It will also include a section to paste in previously processed orders in order to prevent processed orders from being reprinted.
